  "what_labware_offset_is": "A Labware Offset is a type of positional adjustment that accounts for small, real-world variances in the overall position of the labware on an OT-2’s deck. Labware Offset data is unique to a specific combination of labware definition, deck slot, and OT-2.",

During labware position check, she adjust the pipette position while checking the A1 of the labware to 0.2mm in X, and 1.2mm in Z. Later, Bob is preparing to run the same protocol on that robot. The labware offset that Alice created in Slot 6 will be applied for Bob’s protocol unless he changes or clears it.</block>",
  "multiple_modules_explanation": "To use more than one of the same module in a protocol, you first need to plug in the module that’s called first in your protocol to the lowest numbered USB port on the OT-2. Continue in the same manner with additional modules.",

  "multiple_modules_example": "Your protocol has two Temperature Modules. The Temperature Module attached to the first port starting from the left will be related to the first Temperature Module in your protocol while the second Temperature Module loaded would be related to the Temperature Module connected to the next port to the right. If using a hub, follow the same logic with the port ordering.",
